# World Quiz

**This project has a simple goal**

To practice JavaScript and programming logic, it's a 100% original idea so I thought it would worth investing my time on it as my first app created from scratch.

**How it works**

10 Questions about countries, flags and more, questions and countries are randomized, no question is hard-coded, player has 7 seconds to answer each question.

**What I use here**

- JavaScript
- HTML 
- CSS 

In a near future this I'll convert it to React or other library/framework as a personal challenge.
