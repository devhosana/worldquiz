# World Quiz

**This project has a simple goal**

To practice JavaScript and programming logic, it's a 100% original idea so I thought it would worth investing my time on it as my first app created from scratch.

**Here I use**

- JavaScript
- HTML 
- CSS 

In a near future this I'll convert it to React or other library/framework as a personal challenge.
